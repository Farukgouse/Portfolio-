	<li><h3>DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF MECANUM WHEEL COMPONENTS</h3></li>
	<ul>
		<li>I worked on designing and analysis of mecanum wheel components using Creo software which helps to build 2D and 3D models and we can analyze in itself. And finally,
            we analyze that our model and material will work and increase the properties when we compare with previous model.</li>
    </ul>
     <li><h3>DESIGN OF RADIAL PISTON ENGINE USING SOLIDEDGE</h3></li>
     <ul>
     	<li>As a part of my final year diploma, we have Industrial training in that we worked on for designing radial piston engine using solid edge which helps to create 2d or 3d solid models with less complexity in faster and cost-effective way.</li>
